# WRP YARPP-Style Cache System - Implementation Summary

## Overview
This document describes the new YARPP-style cache system implemented for WooCommerce Related Products Pro. The system is based on YARPP's (Yet Another Related Posts Plugin) proven methodology for finding related content using advanced scoring algorithms.

## Key Features

### 1. **Advanced Scoring Algorithm**
- **Title Similarity**: Uses word-based matching with Jaccard similarity algorithm
- **Content Similarity**: Analyzes product descriptions and content for semantic similarity
- **Category Overlap**: Calculates shared category weights with configurable importance
- **Tag Similarity**: Matches products with shared tags
- **Configurable Weights**: Each factor can be weighted according to importance

### 2. **Threshold-Based Filtering**
- **Minimum Score Threshold**: Only includes products that meet a minimum similarity score
- **Quality over Quantity**: Ensures only genuinely related products are displayed
- **Configurable Threshold**: Can be adjusted based on desired strictness

### 3. **Batch Processing**
- **Efficient Processing**: Processes products in configurable batches
- **Memory Management**: Prevents memory issues with large catalogs
- **Progress Tracking**: Provides real-time feedback during cache building

### 4. **Robust Error Handling**
- **Graceful Degradation**: Continues processing even if individual products fail
- **Comprehensive Logging**: Detailed error logging for debugging
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Multiple fallback options for reliability

### 5. **Real-Time Cache Management**
- **Product Invalidation**: Automatically clears cache when products are updated
- **Selective Rebuilding**: Can rebuild cache for individual products
- **Stock-Based Invalidation**: Updates cache when product stock changes

## Technical Implementation

### Cache Table Structure
```sql
CREATE TABLE wp_wrp_related_cache (
    reference_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    related_id bigint(20) NOT NULL,
    score float NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
    date datetime NOT NULL,
    PRIMARY KEY  (reference_id, related_id),
    KEY score (score),
    KEY related_id (related_id),
    KEY date (date)
);
```

### Scoring Algorithm
The system uses a weighted scoring approach:

```
Total Score = (Title_Similarity × Title_Weight) + 
              (Content_Similarity × Content_Weight) + 
              (Category_Overlap × Category_Weight) + 
              (Tag_Similarity × Tag_Weight)
```

### Text Similarity Calculation
Uses the Jaccard similarity algorithm:
```
Jaccard_Similarity = |Set1 ∩ Set2| / |Set1 ∪ Set2|
```

Where:
- Words are tokenized and filtered (stop words removed)
- Only words longer than 2 characters are considered
- Common stop words are filtered out

## Configuration Options

### Default Settings
```php
$default_options = array(
    'threshold' => 5,                    // Minimum score threshold
    'limit' => 4,                        // Number of related products to return
    'weight' => array(
        'title' => 2,                    // Title similarity weight
        'content' => 1,                  // Content similarity weight
        'categories' => 3,               // Category overlap weight
        'tags' => 2,                     // Tag similarity weight
        'custom_taxonomies' => 1         // Custom taxonomy weight
    ),
    'require_tax' => array(
        'product_cat' => 1               // Require at least one shared category
    )
);
```

## Usage Instructions

### 1. **Admin Interface**
- Navigate to: **WooCommerce → Related Products Cache**
- Use the admin panel to:
  - Build cache for all products
  - Check cache status and statistics
  - Clear cache when needed
  - Monitor progress in real-time

### 2. **Cache Building**
- Click **"Build Cache"** to build cache for all products
- Monitor progress with the progress bar
- View detailed statistics including:
  - Total products processed
  - Number of relations created
  - Average similarity score
  - Cache coverage percentage

### 3. **Automatic Management**
- Cache is automatically invalidated when:
  - Products are updated or deleted
  - Product stock changes (if configured)
  - Categories or tags are modified

### 4. **Frontend Display**
- Related products are automatically displayed on product pages
- Uses the existing template system
- Respects all display configuration options
