# Fix for Related Products Not Showing on Product Pages

## Problem Identified
The cache building process was working successfully (180/212 products cached), but related products were not displaying on single product pages or via shortcodes.

## Root Cause Analysis
The issue was in the `get_related_products()` method in `includes/class-wrp-core.php`. The method was trying to use the YARPP cache system first, then falling back to the tables cache system. However:

1. **Cache Priority Issue**: The YARPP cache was being checked first, but the cache that was actually built was using the tables cache system
2. **Different Logic**: Both cache systems use the same database table but have different retrieval logic and thresholds
3. **Empty Results**: The YARPP cache was returning empty results due to different settings/thresholds, preventing the tables cache from being used

## Solution Implemented
Modified the `get_related_products()` method to **prioritize the tables cache system** (which was actually built) over the YARPP cache system.

### Changes Made

**File: `includes/class-wrp-core.php`**

1. **Reordered Cache Priority**: Changed the method to try the tables cache first, then fall back to YARPP cache
2. **Improved Logic Flow**: Added proper initialization and error handling
3. **Enhanced Logging**: Added more detailed logging for debugging

### Before (Problematic Code):
```php
// Try YARPP-style cache system first (most advanced)
try {
    $yarpp_cache = new WRP_YARPP_Cache();
    $related_data = $yarpp_cache->get_related_products($product_id);
    
    if (!empty($related_data)) {
        $related_ids = array_keys($related_data);
        error_log("WRP Core: Found " . count($related_ids) . " related products via YARPP cache");
        return $this->convert_ids_to_products($related_ids, $args);
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    error_log("WRP Core: YARPP cache failed: " . $e->getMessage());
}

// Fallback to original cache system
try {
    // Parse arguments
    $args = wp_parse_args( $args, $this->default_options );
    
    error_log("WRP Core: Getting related products for product ID: $product_id with args: " . json_encode($args));

    // Try to get related product IDs from cache or compute
    $related_ids = $this->cache->get_related_ids( $product_id, $args );
    error_log("WRP Core: Cache returned " . count($related_ids) . " related IDs");
} catch (Exception $e) {
    error_log("WRP Core: Cache failed: " . $e->getMessage() . ", using fallback");
    // Fallback: get some sample products if cache fails
    $related_ids = $this->get_fallback_related_products( $product_id, $args );
}
```

### After (Fixed Code):
```php
// Initialize related_ids array
$related_ids = array();

// Try original cache system first (since that's what was built)
try {
    // Parse arguments
    $args = wp_parse_args( $args, $this->default_options );
    
    error_log("WRP Core: Getting related products for product ID: $product_id with args: " . json_encode($args));

    // Try to get related product IDs from cache or compute
    $related_ids = $this->cache->get_related_ids( $product_id, $args );
    error_log("WRP Core: Cache returned " . count($related_ids) . " related IDs");
    
    // If we found related products, return them
    if (!empty($related_ids)) {
        return $this->convert_ids_to_products($related_ids, $args);
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    error_log("WRP Core: Cache failed: " . $e->getMessage() . ", trying YARPP cache");
}

// Fallback to YARPP-style cache system
try {
    $yarpp_cache = new WRP_YARPP_Cache();
    $related_data = $yarpp_cache->get_related_products($product_id);
    
    if (!empty($related_data)) {
        $related_ids = array_keys($related_data);
        error_log("WRP Core: Found " . count($related_ids) . " related products via YARPP cache");
        return $this->convert_ids_to_products($related_ids, $args);
    }
} catch (Exception $e) {
    error_log("WRP Core: YARPP cache failed: " . $e->getMessage());
}

// If both caches failed, use fallback
if ( empty( $related_ids ) ) {
    error_log("WRP Core: No related IDs found from either cache, using fallback");
    // Fallback: get some sample products if no related products found
    $related_ids = $this->get_fallback_related_products( $product_id, $args );
}

error_log("WRP Core: Final related IDs count: " . count($related_ids));

// Convert to WC_Product objects
return $this->convert_ids_to_products($related_ids, $args);
```

## Expected Results
After this fix, related products should now:

1. **Display on Single Product Pages**: Related products should automatically appear on product pages when auto-display is enabled
2. **Work with Shortcodes**: The `[related_products]` shortcode should now display related products
3. **Use Cached Data**: The system will use the cache that was actually built (180/212 products)
4. **Show Fallback Products**: If no cached related products are found, the system will show fallback products

## Testing Recommendations
1. **Clear Browser Cache**: Refresh your browser to ensure you're seeing the latest changes
2. **Check Product Pages**: Visit single product pages to see if related products now appear
3. **Test Shortcodes**: Try using the `[related_products]` shortcode on a page or post
4. **Monitor Error Logs**: Check for "WRP Core:" messages in your PHP error log for debugging
5. **Verify Auto-Display Settings**: Ensure auto-display is enabled in the plugin settings

## Troubleshooting
If related products still don't appear:

1. **Check Plugin Settings**: Verify that auto-display is enabled and configured correctly
2. **Check Theme Compatibility**: Some themes might override WooCommerce hooks
3. **Check for Conflicts**: Other plugins might be interfering with the display
4. **Check CSS**: The related products might be loaded but hidden by CSS
5. **Check JavaScript**: JavaScript errors might be preventing proper display

## Summary
This fix addresses the core issue preventing related products from displaying by ensuring the system uses the cache that was actually built. The cache building process was working correctly, but the display logic was using the wrong cache system. With this fix, related products should now appear correctly on product pages and work with shortcodes.
